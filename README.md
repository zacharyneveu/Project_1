# Advanced Algorithms Project 2: Knapsack and Graph Coloring Greedy Algorithms
Zach Neveu & Bobby Ky

# Guidelines
+ Your programs should be modular and should make full use of object-oriented programming techniques.  
+ Each class should clearly separate its interface from its implementation.  
+ Use member functions to implement all commonly used operations.  
+ Every function should be documented to describe its function, assumptions and limitations.
+ Each function should validate its inputs and print error messages if the inputs are not correct.
+ Every class should be placed in its own header files.  The class declaration should be placed in a .h file and the function definitions should be in a .c file.
+ Every file should include documentation at the top that gives the name of the file, a description of its contents, and the author(s) of the code.  The main.cpp file should include the project number at the top.
+ Avoid using global variables.
+ Code should be properly indented and formatted.
+ To submit your project, zip together all the project files, including header files, needed to compile your code.  Submit your code by uploading the zip file to Blackboard.  Only one student in each group should upload each project.
+ Your programs will be graded based on the completeness and correctness of your code, quality of the design (use of data abstraction and modularity), and how well your code follows project completion guidelines.  

# Running Instructions
## Coloring
To run graph coloring on all inputs, simply compile p2b.cpp, then run 
```
python run_coloring.py
```
This will run the program on each instance, and dump outputs into the outputs folder.
